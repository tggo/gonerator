# Installations

Type ```go install github.com/tggo/gonerator@latest``` to install, if you have Go installed on your machine. 
If you don't have Go installed, you can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/). And add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file: 

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
```

After that, you can use the `gonerator` command in your terminal.
